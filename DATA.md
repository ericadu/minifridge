- Seasonality: dependent on location, and what item is
- Dietary preferences: common ones (vegan, keto, gluten free), as well as specific allergens (no tomatos, or peanut butter) or preferences (prefer pescatarian, but not strict)
- Shelf life: what item is, how processed (cut or opened or whole), storage (pantry, fridge, freezer)
